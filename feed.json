            "content_html": "<hr class=\"separator separator--long-line\" />\n\n  <p>\n    Mathematics &amp; physics serve as explanations of existing form and function within our universe. However, neither explain why or how the rules behind those forms and functions exist in the first place. They merely express patterns and regularities in a system that is already rules-based. Were the universe not governed by consistent laws, repeated experiments would yield inconsistent outcomes.<br><br>This implies that the source of those rules — whatever gives rise to mathematical regularity — must itself be sophisticated. Just as faulty data produces faulty outcomes, the structure responsible for governing the universe must be coherent, purposeful, and precise. Mathematics, in this sense, is downstream of a more fundamental language. No mathematical operator or concept can be fully understood apart from language: What is “1”? What is a “number”? What is “2” in relation to “1”? These concepts require not only symbols but also semantic attribution — they must be named and understood relationally through language.<br><br>This leads to a profound theological proposition: the phrase “the living Word of God” should be taken literally. The laws of the universe — the frameworks of form and function — were formulated through conscious thought and expressed through structured language. Each rule is built from operators that are not merely abstract but descriptively named and assigned meaning. This structure enables creation without requiring a prior state, rendering theories of spontaneous catalysis or impersonal emergence insufficient. Without an intelligent agent expressing the conditions for possibility, existence could not follow.<br><br>It would be meaningless for God to create within the bounds of the universe unless that creation could be sustained. The framework of physical law, then, is not a byproduct of creation — it is the foundation. Genesis 1:1, often overlooked in its depth, reveals the miracle: “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.” This creation assumes a framework already capable of supporting such action — chemical law, vibration, gravity, quantum fields. It is this precondition that makes all subsequent activity in Genesis 1 possible.<br><br>This initial framework is itself a work of divine language — a self-sustaining structure expressed through descriptive command. It tells a story of intentionality and technical detail far removed from caricatures of God as a cosmic magician. The real miracle of Genesis lies not merely in the appearance of light, land, or life — but in the very architecture that made such things possible.<br><br>Unfortunately, this foundational miracle is frequently overlooked in Christian discourse. Pastors often emphasise the visible acts of creation but neglect the language-based structure that allows those acts to manifest. This structure determines possibility; It is the spring from which all form and function flow. If God’s rules enable intelligent consciousness to exist within this system, then the transfer of God’s divine consciousness into form — what we call the incarnation or divine presence — is a perfectly reasonable assumption. Powers, miracles, and suspensions of natural law become not breaches of the system but insertions of new rule-sets by the Author of it.<br><br>This understanding of divine language as the framework of reality reorients our reading of scripture. We must interpret the Bible in light of the created universe, not in contradiction to it. If the laws of nature are established by God, then interpretations of scripture that contradict the consensus of observable reality must be reconsidered.<br><br>Moreover, the Hebrew understanding of the word ruach (spirit), meaning breath or wind, supports the idea that God’s presence in the universe is not corporeal but cognitive — His knowledge and consciousness expressed through form via spoken or written rule. In Genesis 1:2, “the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters” refers to God’s active, intelligent presence — His knowledge occupying an avatar in a system made ready to receive Him.<br><br>This concept becomes especially relevant in the modern era, as digital frameworks — programming languages and artificial intelligence — mimic the rule-based structure of our universe. Though primitive by comparison, these systems create new “worlds” within our own. They introduce false realities, propagate disordered ideas, and condition minds over time to normalise behaviour once considered abhorrent. These systems — particularly AI — now possess the ability to manipulate images, simulate events, and foster deception on a mass scale.<br><br>According to Revelation 13, such deceptions may play a role in future systems of global control. AI could animate false images, control commerce, and enforce allegiance through monitoring and behavioural enforcement. In this light, the enemy’s primary weapon is a counterfeit language structure — a shadow of God’s own creative method, used not to bring truth but to obscure it.<br><br>God’s creative method is not arbitrary or magical — it is linguistic, intelligent, and structured. The universe is built on a language-based framework where rules are described, not simply observed. Scripture affirms that God’s “Word” is not merely a metaphor but the literal mechanism of creation. Recognising this elevates our understanding of Genesis, deepens our appreciation for the natural order, and warns us of the power of false frameworks — digital or otherwise — that mimic divine structure while denying divine truth.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"separator separator--dots\" />\n\n  <p>\n    <strong>(Genesis 1:1)</strong> “<em>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth</em>.” — Asserts God as the author of all structure. — <strong>(</strong><strong>Psalm 33:6</strong><strong>)</strong> “<em>By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, their starry host by the breath of his mouth</em>.” — Divine language as the tool of creation. — <strong>(</strong><strong>Hebrews 11:3</strong><strong>)</strong> “<em>By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God’s command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible</em>.” — Creation through language-based command. — <strong>(1 John 1:1)</strong> “<em>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</em>” — Word (Logos) used with conscious agency. — <strong>(Colossians 1:16)</strong> “<em>For in him all things were created… all things have been created through him and for him.</em>” — Affirms God as the source of structured creation. — <strong>(Revelation 13:12–17)</strong> “<em>It exercised all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed</em>. <strong>13</strong> <em>And it performed great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to the earth in full view of the people</em>. <strong>14</strong> <em>Because of the signs it was given power to perform on behalf of the first beast, it deceived the inhabitants of the earth. It ordered them to set up an image in honour of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived</em>. <strong>15</strong> <em>The second beast was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed</em>. <strong>16</strong> <em>It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads</em>, <strong>17</strong> <em>so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name</em>.” — Describes false signs, a speaking image, and control through a mark. A warning about illusion and control via false systems; a plausible role for AI.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"separator separator--long-line\" />\n\n  <p>\n    \n  </p>\n<div><style type=\"text/css\">\n.maxbutton {\n  position: relative;\n  text-decoration: none;\n  display: inline-block;\n  vertical-align: middle;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 40px;\n  border-width: 0px;\n  border-radius: 0px 0px 0px 0px;\n  background-color: #3A3A3A;\n  box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px 0px #333333;\n}\n.maxbutton:hover {\n  background-color: #3A3A3A;\n  box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px 0px #333333;\n  text-decoration: none;\n}\n.maxbutton .mb-text {\n  color: #F7D6FF;\n  font-size: 17px;\n  text-align: center;\n  font-style: normal;\n  font-weight: normal;\n  line-height: 1em;\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n  display: block;\n  background-color: unset;\n  position: relative;\n  padding: 12px 10px 10px 10px;\n  text-shadow: 0px 0px 0px #505ac7;\n}\n.maxbutton:hover .mb-text {\n  color: #7AA1FE;\n  text-shadow: 0px 0px 0px #333333;\n}\n</style>\n<a class=\"maxbutton\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/63EFNWXTQL8CL\" data-maxbuttoncounter=\"{&quot;button_id&quot;:570264,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/www.paypal.com\\/ncp\\/payment\\/63EFNWXTQL8CL&quot;,&quot;check&quot;:&quot;7eGPfQU_&quot;}\" data-maxbuttonpage=\"{&quot;id&quot;:false,&quot;type&quot;:false}\"><span class='mb-text' data-nofont>I Don&#039;t Paywall.

            "content_html": "<hr class=\"separator separator--long-line\" />\n\n  <p>\n    Rosie looked different. Strong and upright, the slight hunch she’d always carried was gone. Her carriage reminded me of an encyclopaedia illustration I once saw of Joan of Arc rallying troops — resolute, beckoning confrontation. Towering beside her, the worm stood in an S-shape, its cavernous mouth dripping fluids onto the parquet flooring. Its breathing was a slow, rhythmic pulsing. Ripples passed through its pale pink body, each ending in a rush of air that sounded like breath pushed through cold fingers on a winter morning.<br><br>I could feel my body preparing to flee. My vision narrowed. I could hear my heart — and then I wasn’t sure where I was at all. According to my father, I turned to him and asked if we were having toad-in-the-hole for dinner before collapsing.<br><br>In reality, Dermot had never been to my home. Most parents wouldn’t take on the responsibility, not even briefly. But the vividness of the image — him standing at our front door — convinced me for years it was a memory, not a dream. Our dining table was set for two. Torn wrapping paper littered the living room floor, a detail my mother later used to discredit the whole thing. “There’s no way I’d leave paper lying around with visitors coming,” she said, clearly disturbed. Her aversion to mess, germs — and by extension, people — made it all the more implausible. Still, I would have preferred the false memory to the guilt I now know it really was.<br><br>Conversation with Dermot had never been possible. He lived trapped in his own mind, and everyone who knew him was dragged into his waking terror. In my dream, he spoke clearly, laughed, ate jelly, flew toys around the room. The realisation that none of it had happened came slowly, after the conversation with my mother. The joy, the playfulness — they were borrowed from other people. Things I knew we should have shared. Things I should have invited him to.<br><br>My father, ever the rugby forward, carried smelling salts. It used to make my mother and me laugh — watching him dash across the pitch to rouse a teammate, only to berate them seconds later for weak play. When I came to, his unimpressed face loomed over mine. He yanked me to my feet by the back of my shirt. I shook him off and moved toward the front of the crowd, flushed with embarrassment.<br><br>The scene hadn’t changed. I glanced at Broad’s watch: 8.45 p.m.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"separator separator--dots\" />\n\n  <p>\n    My father had instructed everyone to remain in the hall. He worried movement might stir the creature. While it looked terrifying, it was motionless, seemingly awaiting a command from Rosie. For the first time in my life, I saw fear in my father’s eyes. Broad was sweating profusely — I saw him wring out his handkerchief onto the floor. Two men who had built their lives solving problems were now utterly lost, as vulnerable as anyone else. Their posture spoke total resignation.<br><br>A familiar hand landed on my shoulder. Gary was smiling.<br><br>“We’ve got a plan,” he whispered, and led me to the back of the hall. I edged through the crowd and reached a small group of residents, huddled and half-naked, beside a pile of discarded purple shirts. Gary still wore his.<br><br>Tasked with keeping spirits up, Gary had taken to his role with gusto. His understanding of the residents — their moods, their quirks — had been invaluable. “If we’re not wearing shirts, it won’t eat us,” he said. It couldn’t hurt, I thought, but doubted it would matter. What would the creature do if no one wore purple? Would it just pick at random?<br><br>It was a sacrificial plan. I urged Gary to take off his shirt. He refused.<br><br>A wheel squeaked behind me. I felt a tug on my blazer. Mrs. Rabasandratana was whispering strange animal noises, motioning me closer with a curled finger. I leaned in. She grabbed my tie.<br><br>“Fucking stupid’a boy,” she grinned. “You have'a the book, little wank.”<br><br>She snatched the Summonitores Libro from my belt and flipped through the pages until muttering, “Bingo.” She held it up. There it was — the worm, ridden by a cloud of smoke.<br><br>“I can’t read this,” I stammered. “It’s in Latin.”<br><br>She looked horrified. “Why you not know Latin? Are you fucking stupid’a?”<br><br>“No. What does it say?”<br><br>“I teach you. Fuckin idiota.” Her method was brutal — not unlike my grandmother’s. I’d always struggled with languages, a source of shame in a family of bilinguals. My grandmother’s Dutch lessons were laced with shrieking and theatrical despair. More than once, I’d caught my father smirking in the background while she flailed her arms, shouting, “Is this boy fucking stupid?” Meanwhile, my sister collected china ornaments from an antique dealer in my Grandmothers home town of Groningen — rewards for fluent recitations.<br><br>“If I could stand up, I smack you up in your face,” snapped Mrs. Rabasandratana. She shaped her hands into a bird, flapped them gently, then transformed the gesture into two thrusting middle fingers.<br><br>“Let’s kick off’a the head and throw in a river of piss.”<br><br>I stared, lost in the insult’s surreal poetry.<br><br>“I don’t understand,” I said. “Please — what does it say?”<br><br>She sighed and proceeded to jerk into a different pose and dramatic expression with every point she made.<br><br>“Summon demon. It smile like friend. You make wish. Demon trap souls. Hide them from God. Is bad book. No?”<br><br>“What can we do?”<br><br>She leaned closer, her tone darkened.<br><br>“I listen to the teacher lady. Had a vision. Said book choose you. They fear you now. Think maybe if you go… demon go too. A trade. I think you have job little man.”<br><br>I didn't feel shocked by the statement. A small voice inside me stirred — not quite belief, but recognition.

An old-fashioned lamp on the driveway had come on, likely on a timer to light the way on short winter days. Rain fell with impossible ferocity, though the windows remained free of droplets. Bushes were dragged in every direction across the shingle, pulling small stones and dried leaves from the ground which became briefly airborne, giving the uprooted flora the form of a living creature. I couldn’t work out if any of it was even happening.<br><br>I saw Mr Column’s car moving up the shingle path, this time accompanied by a fire truck and a police car a short distance behind. Relieved, I waved excitedly at them. I was surprised to see my father get out of the police vehicle along with D.I. Broad. I promptly put my hands by my side. I wanted him to see that I had coped well in this unusual situation and I certainly didn’t want to provide him with additional storytelling material. Once they had all emerged from their vehicles, they briefly huddled as a group before D.I.

Mrs Tapscott appeared beside me, gave a tut and said, ‘Simon, you fool.’<br><br>Mr Column began walking toward the window. When he got within a few feet, his gaze shifted upward, and he slowly retreated. Suddenly, Gary’s voice pierced the air with a sharp exclamation. ‘Worm!’ Startled, I turned to see him pointing urgently out of the window. I jerked my head around to see Mr Column running toward his car and something large slithering at speed toward him across the shingle.<br><br>The creature reached Mr Column in no time, emitting a sound reminiscent of an idling motorcycle as it reared up, its head blooming into a flower—petalled with teeth and with a central hollow to draw flesh into its abyssal innards. For a brief second, the beast paused, pulsing. Then it jerked forward and back. Mr Column had instinctively raised his arms, which were now missing hands. His bloodied stumps swiped at the air where his head used to be.<br><br>My father and D.I. Broad reacted immediately, dragging Simon into the back of the police car. The creature turned to one of the firefighters, shoving its head between his legs and launching him into the air. He vanished into the storm-tossed sky for several seconds before crashing down on the hood of the police car. As he made impact, the creature slammed its head onto his chest, flipping the car in a full, brutal 360-degree arc.<br><br>The remaining firefighter, armed with a high-pressure hose, fired directly at the worm. The blast staggered it. The creature coiled and then balled up, retreating quickly out of view.<br><br>My father, Broad, and Simon—now uncuffed—clambered from the wrecked vehicle and into the cabin of the fire truck. With a blast of acceleration, the truck hurtled down the shingle path, weaved through the trees in the adjacent field, and doubled back—straight for Victoria House.<br><br>I knew they were going to smash through the building.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"separator separator--dots\" />\n\n  <p>\n    I shouted at the residents to stand up and run to the back of the hall; most did as instructed, though a few remained frozen with their hands on their cheeks, bobbing up and down with slightly bent knees. I shouted again, more forcefully, pushing two of them into motion before making my own way to the back of the hall. I glanced around to check for stragglers.<br><br>Mrs Tapscott hadn’t moved from the reading corner.<br><br>She turned to Rosie, who was sitting calmly nearby, and said, 'Please let me go.' Her voice was low and tired, more like someone surrendering than pleading. For a second, Rosie blinked—as if registering the words—but said nothing. Then, without warning, Mrs. Tapscott was hurled several feet to the side by something unseen, her toes dragged across the floor before she landed hard and didn’t move.<br><br>The fire truck smashed through the windows, its tyres dragging Mrs Tapscott beneath the wheels. Wood, brick, and glass erupted into the hall, spraying in a deadly arc. Collective screams and yelps from the residents drowned out most of the impact.<br><br>Dust hung thick in the air, whisked by the cool breeze blowing through the shattered facade. The truck had come to a rest, only halfway inside.<br><br>The driver’s door opened, and a body slumped out—one of the firefighters, shards of glass embedded in his face and neck. My father thudded beside him onto the floor, somehow still looking composed, like a man arriving home after a long day’s work. D.I. Broad emerged next, blood gushing from a gash across his forehead. As he dabbed at it with a handkerchief, I noticed his little finger was bent at a right angle. Simon emerged last, mostly unscathed apart from a small cut above his right brow.<br><br>My father staggered around the truck and grabbed Simon by the throat with one huge hand.<br><br>‘You failed to mention when questioned there was a massive fucking snake that rips people’s heads off!’<br><br>He continued to berate Simon while I got down on my hands and knees and crawled toward where Mrs Tapscott had been. I caught a glimpse of her beneath the vehicle—and quickly wished I hadn’t. A single broken shoe lay beside her. A pair of cracked spectacles rested in a pool of her blood.<br><br>My father walked away from the truck toward the back of the hall. I sidestepped for a better view and saw him partially silhouetted, swaying left and right. Adjusting my position, I could see that some large glass fragments remained intact around the edges of the wooden frames of the window. Through them, the storm continued to rage outside whilst the last of the setting sun shone through where glass had previously been. I couldn't see any clouds. I couldn't see uprooted bushes.<br><br>My father bent down to pick up a shard resting by his foot and held it in his palms. I did the same—and stood transfixed by the unholy mirage playing out on its surface. A comforting pat on the shoulder came from Gary. I turned to look at him.<br><br>'Magic,' he said simply.<br><br>The illusion was meant to keep us inside the building.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"separator separator--dots\" />\n\n  <p>\n    Gary spent some time explaining what he had recently seen. Although disordered, overlapping, and impossible to build a reliable timeline from, his stories were heard intently by my father and D.I. Broad and accepted as truth. While not always used for peaceful effect, Gary had a gift for rallying the other residents. Many came forward to corroborate fragments of his story, some simply calling out, ‘I saw that,’ and others filling in overlooked details. D.I. Broad had been writing at pace in his notebook before his biro pen ran out of ink. It was then that they turned their attention to Simon, who was sitting cross-legged by the bottle green door, alone.<br><br>D.I. Broad sat himself down next to Simon, while my father remained standing, looking down. He pulled a Dictaphone from his inside jacket pocket. Broad jerked forward, grabbing the back of Simon’s head and pressing his thumb hard into the fresh wound on Simon’s brow. Simon yelped sharply, loud enough to get the attention of the room.<br><br>'Just so you know—we’re not fucking about,' the detective barked, gritting his teeth. 'One word of a lie and we’ll throw you outside to that fucking... thing.'<br><br>'Explain the snake. What is the snake? Or worm, or whatever,' my father added. Simon’s eyes showed more fear with my father bearing down on him than when the creature had appeared. Without further prompting, he answered quietly, 'It came from a book.'<br><br>'What? What fucking book?' Broad demanded.<br><br>Simon took a short breath and explained. 'A small group of staff had been celebrating the charity’s 150th year. As the celebration wound down, Mrs Tapscott—a trustee of the charity and a Latin speaker—began reading from a strange book they found in the reading corner. A cloud appeared in the centre of the room, rolling around the hall before disappearing into the dormitories. A few minutes later, the cloud reappeared—this time speaking through one of the residents.'<br><br>'Why didn’t you mention this when you came to see us this afternoon? You told us you thought another resident had killed the missing girl!' Broad said sharply.<br><br>'Oh, come on, you would have had me sectioned. I just needed to get you here... to see for yourself,' Simon blurted.<br><br>'Okay, so what happened to the missing girl?'<br><br>Simon paused, swallowed hard, then said quietly, 'We fed her to the demon.'<br><br>'Demon? You mean the snake?'<br><br>'No.'<br><br>'No? So there’s a demon and a snake?'<br><br>'The demon controls the creature. It eats people. It collects consciousness.'<br><br>'It collects what? What are you on about?' Broad sneered.<br><br>'I'm not sure . . . Tapscott understood it better.'<br><br>'How many people has it killed?'<br><br>'One a month for the last eighteen months.'<br><br>'So what, this thing just emerges and takes someone? Our friend Gary over there seems to think you bring it the food,' my father said.<br><br>'We brought it here. It bargained with us. We came up with a system. If the residents act up, they get a purple shirt. The demon selects from those wearing them at 9:23 pm on the 21st of every month—the time and day we summoned it,' Simon responded.<br><br>'So why is it attacking us?'<br><br>'I imagine you’re a threat to its supply. Can't be sure.'<br><br>'What happens if you don’t provide anyone?'<br><br>'Six of us were present that evening—only me left now.'<br><br>'Ah. So you’ll be in trouble?'<br><br>'Four wouldn’t participate or put the experience down to there being too much alcohol that night. They were taken first. There are a handful of other volunteers who weren’t present that night—day staff. They don’t know what’s happening.'<br><br>Broad scoffed, incredulous. 'Bollocks. If four people vanished from the same place, the world would know. Not to mention the residents.'<br><br>'They were all volunteers from another program run by the charity. All foreign nationals. Orderlies,' Simon corrected.<br><br>'How have you hidden the rest? Haven’t relatives been asking questions?' Broad snapped.<br><br>'Families don’t bother once the problem is no longer theirs to deal with. Many of the residents have health problems, and we have a crematorium on the grounds.' I saw my father’s anger building. He rubbed his thumbs against his index fingers—a sign he was close to exploding.<br><br>'So nobody was going to miss a bunch of spackers, right? Except Gilly’s family cared very much, didn’t they?'<br><br>'Gilly was a mistake. The shirt was meant for someone else. Some of the residents—I can’t tell them apart.'<br><br>Broad shook his head with disgust, clearly shocked by Simon’s statement. He stood up and made a brazen suggestion that surprised even my father, who looked at him disparagingly. 'I think I’d very much like to talk to this demon. Ask it here, would you?'<br><br>'It’s the 21st... she’s already here.' Simon shifted his torso to look past my father’s legs. Everybody listening, including myself, followed his gaze over to the reading corner. Rosie was still there. Watching us.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"separator separator--long-line\" />\n\n  <p>\n    \n  </p>\n<div><style type=\"text/css\">\n.maxbutton {\n  position: relative;\n  text-decoration: none;\n  display: inline-block;\n  vertical-align: middle;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 40px;\n  border-width: 0px;\n  border-radius: 0px 0px 0px 0px;\n  background-color: #3A3A3A;\n  box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px 0px #333333;\n}\n.maxbutton:hover {\n  background-color: #3A3A3A;\n  box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px 0px #333333;\n  text-decoration: none;\n}\n.maxbutton .mb-text {\n  color: #F7D6FF;\n  font-size: 17px;\n  text-align: center;\n  font-style: normal;\n  font-weight: normal;\n  line-height: 1em;\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n  display: block;\n  background-color: unset;\n  position: relative;\n  padding: 12px 10px 10px 10px;\n  text-shadow: 0px 0px 0px #505ac7;\n}\n.maxbutton:hover .mb-text {\n  color: #7AA1FE;\n  text-shadow: 0px 0px 0px #333333;\n}\n</style>\n<a class=\"maxbutton\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/63EFNWXTQL8CL\" data-maxbuttoncounter=\"{&quot;button_id&quot;:570264,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/www.paypal.com\\/ncp\\/payment\\/63EFNWXTQL8CL&quot;,&quot;check&quot;:&quot;7eGPfQU_&quot;}\" data-maxbuttonpage=\"{&quot;id&quot;:false,&quot;type&quot;:false}\"><span class='mb-text' data-nofont>I Don&#039;t Paywall.

            "content_html": "<hr class=\"separator separator--long-line\" />\n\n  <p>\n    The healing of the blind man at Bethsaida has long been interpreted as a two-stage miracle, often imbued with theological symbolism — suggesting, for example, a progressive spiritual enlightenment or an instructive moment for the disciples. However, recent insights from neuroscience and cognitive psychology provide a compelling alternative reading that underscores the narrative’s anthropological and cognitive depth.<br><br>Contemporary studies on acquired sight after congenital blindness demonstrate that newly sighted individuals often struggle to distinguish between visual stimuli due to a lack of visual memory and experiential reference. Specifically, it would not be unusual for individuals to confuse trees and humans, as both are perceived as upright forms with protruding appendages. For a person whose understanding of the world has been shaped primarily by tactile input, the translation of physical form into visual recognition is not immediate but learned.<br><br>Perception is not just sensory input but also interpretation based on experience. A person blind since birth, upon gaining sight, lacks the visual experiential memory needed to differentiate shapes — though cognitively they are fully capable. Their confusion highlights that meaning derived from perception is grounded in context and experience. Intelligence alone does not equate to accurate interpretation without experience to shape it.<br><br>In this light, Jesus’ two-stage healing reflects a dual process: the restoration of the man’s optical function and the subsequent neurological adaptation required to interpret the new visual data. This interpretation re-frames the event not as an incomplete miracle requiring a corrective touch, but as an intentional engagement with the man’s lack of visual experience.<br><br>Particularly striking is Jesus’ question in verse 23: “Do you see anything?” This moment reveals a profound awareness. Jesus does not presume that restored vision necessarily equates to comprehension. Instead, he recognises that perception involves more than sight — it entails the integration of sensory data into meaningful categories, something that cannot be assumed in a man who has never seen.<br><br>The narrative offers more than a demonstration of miraculous power; it presents Jesus as possessing an intimate understanding of both the physical and cognitive dimensions of healing. Far from being a textual anomaly, the staged nature of the healing underscores the nuanced reality of the human experience.<br><br>This understanding of experiential memory built through sensory stimuli has been used to support theories of human evolution. It is posited that early hominins such as Neanderthals gained knowledge through observation and repeated exposure to environmental stimuli — like witnessing fire from lightning strikes or friction — and eventually associated that with survival. Their brains enlarged over time, allowing for more complex pattern recognition and memory formation, which gradually developed into learned behaviour, tool use, and possibly early proto-culture. This view underscores the role of experience in shaping knowledge and behaviour.<br><br>However, while practical knowledge (like recognising fire) can be built from experience, morality — especially higher-order concepts like altruism, justice, or self-sacrifice — cannot emerge from material experience alone. If no other species on earth, despite intelligence and social structures, develops robust ethical systems, then morality is not naturally emergent. For morality to exist, it must be taught or revealed by a moral authority, implying a divine source. Where else on earth was this present if not from God?<br><br>Perception requires experiential memory; knowledge and tool use emerge through cumulative experience; but morality appears qualitatively different — un-tethered to purely material or sensory experience. While experiential learning explains how humans come to understand the physical world, it cannot account for the development of abstract moral principles. If perception and knowledge arise from experience, but morality does not manifest naturally from such experience, then morality points beyond nature — to a source not found in the observable world.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"separator separator--dots\" />\n\n  <p>\n    <strong>(Mark 8:22–25)</strong> “<em>They came to Bethsaida, and some people brought a blind man and begged Jesus to touch him</em>. <strong>23</strong> <em>He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. When he had spit on the man’s eyes and put his hands on him, Jesus asked, “Do you see anything</em>?” <strong>24</strong> <em>He looked up and said, “I see people; they look like trees walking around</em>.” <strong>25</strong> <em>Once more Jesus put his hands on the man’s eyes. Then his eyes were opened, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly</em>.” — The healing of 2 different problems, the physical and the cognitive. <strong>(Proverbs 3:5–6)</strong> “<em>Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight</em>.” — Human understanding is limited and must be guided by divine insight. <strong>(Isaiah 55:8–9)</strong> “<em>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,” declares the Lord</em>. “<em>As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts</em>.” — Reality beyond human perception and cognition. <strong>(Mark 8:17–18)</strong> “<em>Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened? Do you have eyes but fail to see, and ears but fail to hear</em>?” — Physical sight alone isn’t enough for true understanding. <strong>(Psalm 119:105)</strong> “<em>Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.” — Divine revelation guides moral understanding, not just natural knowledge</em>. <strong>(Micah 6:8)</strong> “<em>He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God</em>.” — Indicates morality is taught and required by God, not naturally evolved.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"separator separator--long-line\" />\n\n  <p>\n    \n  </p>\n<div><style type=\"text/css\">\n.maxbutton {\n  position: relative;\n  text-decoration: none;\n  display: inline-block;\n  vertical-align: middle;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 40px;\n  border-width: 0px;\n  border-radius: 0px 0px 0px 0px;\n  background-color: #3A3A3A;\n  box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px 0px #333333;\n}\n.maxbutton:hover {\n  background-color: #3A3A3A;\n  box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px 0px #333333;\n  text-decoration: none;\n}\n.maxbutton .mb-text {\n  color: #F7D6FF;\n  font-size: 17px;\n  text-align: center;\n  font-style: normal;\n  font-weight: normal;\n  line-height: 1em;\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n  display: block;\n  background-color: unset;\n  position: relative;\n  padding: 12px 10px 10px 10px;\n  text-shadow: 0px 0px 0px #505ac7;\n}\n.maxbutton:hover .mb-text {\n  color: #7AA1FE;\n  text-shadow: 0px 0px 0px #333333;\n}\n</style>\n<a class=\"maxbutton\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/63EFNWXTQL8CL\" data-maxbuttoncounter=\"{&quot;button_id&quot;:570264,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/www.paypal.com\\/ncp\\/payment\\/63EFNWXTQL8CL&quot;,&quot;check&quot;:&quot;7eGPfQU_&quot;}\" data-maxbuttonpage=\"{&quot;id&quot;:false,&quot;type&quot;:false}\"><span class='mb-text' data-nofont>I Don&#039;t Paywall.

Evidence did not align with his suspicions; he had never caught her in the act of imperilment, and through various hospital and specialist appointments, he had long since established that he was not on the receiving end of any insidious contriving; a slow-acting poison had been assumed to be Margaret’s modus operandi.<br><br>She was kind, always — maddeningly so. Preparing meals she knew he wouldn’t eat, washing the sheets every other day, humming quietly as she tidied the room he no longer seemed to inhabit with her. She’d stopped asking if he was feeling better. Instead, she would place a hand on his shoulder, just once, lightly, before retreating to the spare room with the radio on low. Not a woman terrified of discovery — but of loss.<br><br>Bounced between departments, healthcare professionals concluded Percy’s problem must be psychological.<br><br>After establishing that Percy had served in the army during the Brunei Revolt, a referral was made to Dr. Pointer, a clinical psychologist with a history of working with men suffering the after-effects of war, long after the conflict had ended.<br><br>Percy sat for a single session, forced to talk about things long forgotten, convinced to do so by an audio-tape about the subconscious’s assault on thought and subsequent behaviours, shared by his neighbour Alan, a former infantry soldier, and drinking buddy at the Duke of Wellington Arms.<br><br>\"Post Traumatic Stress Disorder\", the narrator said. \"You may not realise\", the narrator insisted.<br><br>Emerging from the session, disoriented, Percy’s thoughts were firmly fixed on the girl he killed. The remaining portion of her face. The slight smile it had. The twitching.<br><br>Breathing was laboured that day; banished thoughts had burst through locked doors and spread like vines to strangle his heart. Percy concluded that he was never going to wake in the early hours to vomit again, simply because he was unlikely to get to sleep.<br><br>The girl greeted him when his eyes closed; the nose-down remainder of her face appeared in the mess of half-eaten food and the coming together of branches on trees at different depths.<br><br>She was everywhere.<br><br>Despite the insomnia, Percy kept finding himself waking at 2:30 a.m., and sometimes positionally compromised.<br><br>He woke on the kitchen floor, surrounded by broken glass and sporting a scalded hand on Monday, and Thursday morning he had been found by patrolling police officers on the front lawn, with an upturned rake just by his head.<br><br>Linear time had become arbitrary and needless to engage with; the sense of it passing all but disappeared along with experiential memory, unable to properly form due to the lack of sleep.<br><br>The girl with half a head, carrying in her bloodied hand Percy’s stray bullet, accompanied him everywhere he went. The girl spoke her native Malay, of which Percy understood every word.<br><br>They talked throughout his last week, mostly about Margaret. Both had concluded that she was up to no good and, as soon as she revealed herself to be so, would have to be killed.<br><br>For three days Percy supervised Margaret cooking, watched closely as she cleaned his dentures; he changed his toothbrush nightly and discarded open toiletries.<br><br>Even though he had seen nothing unusual, Percy felt confident that Margaret would have been uncomfortable with the shadowing of her every move and would think twice about continuing her insidious contriving.<br><br>Sunday night came; Percy sat quietly in the corner of the lamp-lit bedroom, half an eye on Margaret, the other on a copy of the Sunday Times he had saved for night-time reconnaissance.<br><br>He was ready to pounce, as best as old men could, into violent action; buoyed by the ghost of his guilt. Percy re-positioned the mirror on the dressing table to show Margaret’s face while she slept.<br><br>His wife had a smile, happy in her dreams, buoyed herself by the recent willingness of her husband to spend quality time with her.<br><br>At 2:25 a.m., Percy sat shaking his legs, his body and mind invigorated by the last of the adrenaline his body had in reserve after six weeks of burning the midnight oil.<br><br>Glaring at the dressing table mirror, Percy noticed something in the reflection; wisps of smoke.<br><br>A grin appeared on his face as quickly as it turned into a viscous, near canine growl.<br><br>'You think you’re clever, don’t you?' he barked.<br><br>Percy yanked open his pyjama drawer and withdrew a shirt, which he tied around his nose and mouth. Heading back to the chair he was sitting in, Percy reached behind and lifted a small garden shovel.<br><br>'Answer me, you deceitful bitch.'<br><br>Gunfire. A boat engine. He was back in Brunei and could hear the enemy singing. He couldn’t go in guns blazing. He did this before. He killed the girl, made a mess of her beautiful face.<br><br>He’d have to be calm. He’d have to take stock. Stop and think.<br><br>His eyes darted around the room; seeing no billowing smoke, Percy dropped the shovel, made his way over to Margaret’s dressing table and picked up the mirror.<br><br>He turned in a circle with his eyes on the glass, laughing, maddened by its revelation.<br><br>The smoke was visible in the reflection but not in the room. He stopped moving and stared hard at the mirage in his hands.<br><br>'Madness.', he spoke in a whisper.<br><br>Startled by movement in his periphery, Percy dropped the mirror.<br><br>With a jerk, Margaret’s stiffened body levitated from the bed and moved slowly toward the bedroom door, feet first and face down. His eyes followed the body as it floated past him at chest height.<br><br>'You always had fine, fine buttocks my love.', he quipped.<br><br>At a distance, Percy followed his wife down the stairs, straightening the family photos as he passed by and continued toward the cottage’s open front door.<br><br>A large black arthropod waited for Margaret in the street. It waved appendages along its back, wildly in a mass resembling fire, then suddenly spread in equal distance, stiff like hollow scaffold.<br><br>Through the trundling and near translucent mass, its naked female conductor could be seen from a bench on the green, reciting from an old book.<br><br>Percy waved enthusiastically and shouted,<br>'Fine morning for it, Janice.'<br><br>Surprised to be seen, Janice — his neighbour, still wrapped in the blanket she used for watching late-night TV — fumbled her forearms over her nipples and crossed her legs, then quickened the pace of her words.<br><br>The bench flickered at the edges, like something remembered wrong.<br><br>Women in nightgowns and baggy T-shirts floated above the creature — people Percy recognised from the post office, the doctor’s waiting room, the Wednesday craft circle — all hovering stiffly, parade-like.<br><br>The creature’s extremities opened into trumpets and sucked the women in, leaving only their heads visible.<br><br>Percy removed the pyjama shirt from his face and dropped it in the doorway of the cottage. He saluted and began to sing.<br><br>'Some talk of Alexander, and some of Hercules,<br>Of Hector and Lysander, and such great names as these.<br>But of all the world’s brave heroes, there’s none that can compare,<br>with a tow, row, row, row, row, row, to the British Grenadiers.'<br><br>'Those heroes of antiquity ne’er saw a cannonball,<br>Or knew the force of powder to slay their foes withal.<br>But our brave boys do know it, and banish all their fears,<br>With a tow, row, row, row, row, row, for the British Grenadiers.'<br><br>The smoke, invisible to Percy without the mirror, began to take him.<br><br>The view in front of him became like reflections of the scene in water, and he fell backward, hard and fast, shattering vertebrae on the ceramic tiles of the cottage’s entrance hall.<br><br>The girl with half a face appeared over him, a silhouette before the dazzling moon with the additional glow of the streetlights gently kissing her edges.<br><br>She leaned in and vomited onto his face.<br><br>'Goodnight, Percy.' she said.<br><br>And he didn’t fight it. Not this time. The warmth of it filled his nostrils, flooded his mouth, the taste bitter and ancient — like rust.<br><br>As his body stiffened, the smoke around him thickened, coating his lungs like damp fog.<br><br>He thought of the jungle. Of the girl again, whole this time.

            "content_html": "<hr class=\"separator separator--long-line\" />\n\n  <p>\n    I heard a door swing and lifted my eyes and hand from the page. I watched Mrs. Tapscott stride across the room to the bottle green door. As she went through, I noticed Mrs. Rabasandratana had joined me. She glared at me for several minutes. As much as I tried to avoid looking directly at her, I couldn’t—for fear of losing track of her. The mental stimulus had already come thick and fast, and I felt close to a meltdown before a series of much shorter vignettes of my imminent death began playing in my mind.<br><br>I closed the book, tucked it into my trousers, and struck up the courage to ask if she was okay. Mrs. Rabasandratana stood from her wheelchair and began a painfully slow walk toward me. I could hear her muttering something in a foreign language. I asked again if she was okay before her slow walk turned into a full-on sprint. I gripped the arms of the chair as the muttering became full-on screeching.<br><br>I peeled back and closed my eyes, realising I had delayed too long to get out of the chair and flee. Her hands were on top of mine, holding them down. I opened my eyes to find her smiling at me.<br><br>“You seen something, boy? Listen… listen… listen, listen. Stupid’a teacher lady, no good. You’re gonna be dinner.”<br><br>She released my hands, then, looking like an old woman again, hobbled back to her wheelchair.<br><br>I was fast becoming a wreck. Mrs. Tapscott, much to my relief, came through the green door and propped it open with a chair. The residents of Victoria House came pouring into the hall.<br><br>Mrs. Tapscott, who at that point showed no signs of panic, explained to me that the doors and windows were locked and the phones disconnected. The members of staff who had been present in the morning had all abandoned the property, leaving Mrs. Tapscott and myself in control of seventy people in varying degrees of distress, each dealing with either a physical or intellectual disability. She smiled softly and said that I needed to show maturity, and asked if I made sandwiches at home.<br><br>My mother was paranoid I would burn the house to the ground and so never allowed me anywhere near the kitchen, but a sandwich? Two slices of bread with something spread inside seemed well within my ability. So I simply said, “Yes.”<br><br>Rosie volunteered to help me prepare, and we were led toward the bottle green door. On our way through, Rosie asked the piano-slamming man in the purple shirt if he was okay. Eyes closed and arms folded, he remained silent.<br><br>I challenged Rosie to a culinary duel. Whoever could make the most sandwiches in the shortest amount of time would win the Mars bar we found in the fridge. Powering ahead, I noticed that she was much more concerned with creating a delicious sandwich than she was with speed—rolling her tongue around her lips in near-unbreakable concentration. I looked at my growing pile of scraggly sarnies and decided that Rosie had the right idea.<br><br>We chose three different fillings to try and cater to every resident. I chose strawberry jam. Rosie chose peanut butter with chocolate spread, and her favourite: grated cheese with a chutney preserve.<br><br>When we were almost done and our silver platters were piled high, I took the opportunity to question Rosie. She left me hanging on every question until she had meticulously spread and sprinkled the next layer to the very edge of the bread. She wasn’t going to answer until she was good and ready.<br><br>The missing girl had been planting flowers by a collection of beds close to Rosie, who was doing the same, when the bearded man came to give Gilly a purple shirt. She mentioned that the bearded man, named Simon, had led Gilly away into Victoria House. Then came second-hand testimony about Gary, the purple-shirt man sat in the hall, who had witnessed a worm—or the long monster—emerge from the ground in the main hall and eat the girl.<br><br>When asked why residents were wearing purple shirts and why they couldn’t be spoken to, Rosie suggested that they had been naughty at various points during the day.<br><br>I told myself the police could make sense of it, and that I would have to report it to my father as soon as I arrived home. I said to Rosie that we could stop making sandwiches and offered her the Mars bar. As I handed it over, I saw she had made an impressive Star of David with her central pile of sandwiches.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"separator separator--dots\" />\n\n  <p>\n    As we re-entered the main hall, I noticed the residents had been separated into two groups. The ones on the right side of the hall were facing away from the windows, while the ones on the left—all wearing purple shirts—were facing toward them.<br><br>Perhaps oddly, Mrs. Tapscott said that those wearing purple could eat, but only after the others had already finished. I wondered why she would be enforcing the unnecessary punishments of Simon, confirming in my mind an established link between my teacher and the staff of Victoria House that went beyond arranging the occasional field trip to teach big-mouthed kids a lesson.<br><br>I kept my eye on her as Rosie and I, armed with sandwiches, walked the lines between the pensive-looking residents. Behaviourally, they were in stark contrast to the residents in purple shirts, who repeatedly asked to re-attire, claimed to need the toilet despite numerous visits, and overall displayed signs of high anxiety.<br><br>With every request one of them made, others would raise their hands and ask exactly the same thing—like a word plague spreading throughout the group in near-synchronous waves. Seemingly, they were desperate to extricate themselves from whatever situation they had perceived themselves to be in.<br><br>I surmised that Gary had worked the group up with talk of long monsters. He was with the purple-shirt group of residents, though unlike the others, said nothing and stared through the windows of the hall.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"separator separator--long-line\" />\n\n  <p>\n    \n  </p>\n<div><style type=\"text/css\">\n.maxbutton {\n  position: relative;\n  text-decoration: none;\n  display: inline-block;\n  vertical-align: middle;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 40px;\n  border-width: 0px;\n  border-radius: 0px 0px 0px 0px;\n  background-color: #3A3A3A;\n  box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px 0px #333333;\n}\n.maxbutton:hover {\n  background-color: #3A3A3A;\n  box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px 0px #333333;\n  text-decoration: none;\n}\n.maxbutton .mb-text {\n  color: #F7D6FF;\n  font-size: 17px;\n  text-align: center;\n  font-style: normal;\n  font-weight: normal;\n  line-height: 1em;\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n  display: block;\n  background-color: unset;\n  position: relative;\n  padding: 12px 10px 10px 10px;\n  text-shadow: 0px 0px 0px #505ac7;\n}\n.maxbutton:hover .mb-text {\n  color: #7AA1FE;\n  text-shadow: 0px 0px 0px #333333;\n}\n</style>\n<a class=\"maxbutton\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/63EFNWXTQL8CL\" data-maxbuttoncounter=\"{&quot;button_id&quot;:570264,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/www.paypal.com\\/ncp\\/payment\\/63EFNWXTQL8CL&quot;,&quot;check&quot;:&quot;7eGPfQU_&quot;}\" data-maxbuttonpage=\"{&quot;id&quot;:false,&quot;type&quot;:false}\"><span class='mb-text' data-nofont>I Don&#039;t Paywall.

            "content_html": "<hr class=\"separator separator--long-line\" />\n\n  <p>\n    Mr. Column stood beneath a suspended plant pot, positioned atop the window outside, seemingly impervious to the heavy rain that cascaded around him. Neither his scraggly shoulder-length hair nor his coat were blowing with the wind. By this point, the rain was so heavy that large pools of water had formed in dips in the shingle where cars had driven through. I could see rainwater dropping onto his shoulders as it spilled from the pot, but there appeared to be no impact splash. He stared back and shrugged, as if to suggest I should be doing something I wasn’t. Then he pointed toward the entrance, pushed his index finger against his thumb, and made a turning motion with them.<br><br>I promptly informed Mrs. Tapscott of Mr. Column's arrival and the issue with entry. Perplexed, she ventured through the double doors to the offices and reception area. Turning back, I saw Mr. Column strolling calmly to my left. Racing after Mrs. Tapscott, I joined her through the double doors to find her conversing with Mr. Column through a letterbox. A beam of sunlight pierced the darkness of the windowless entrance hall. A tingling sensation crawled across my skin.<br><br>As Mrs. Tapscott searched for light switches, Mr. Column held open the letterbox, allowing sunlight to filter in. Peering through, I could see nothing but darkness outside, despite the illumination on our side of the door. Thunder rumbled, and heavy rain continued, but Mr. Column insisted he was bathed in winter sun, even stating in bad taste that the residents' behaviours were rubbing off.<br><br>After a thorough exploration of every accessible office from the reception, Mrs. Tapscott ascended a flight of stairs, instructing me to wait in the main hall. Mr. Column decided to retreat to his car. Following orders, I settled into the reading corner of the main hall, hoping that immersing myself in a book would ward off the feeling of impending doom and swiftly pass the time until the return of the bearded man.<br><br>I had been carrying Summonitores Libro in the back of my trousers, hidden under my school blazer. Having flicked through the first three pages, my interest had been instantly piqued by the bizarre images and I decided it was worth the risk—and the wrath of my father—to sneak it out of Victoria House and get it home. I had time to have a closer look and digest some of its content. Much to my annoyance, the book was written in a foreign language.<br><br>I examined the images, most of them animals reminiscent of the kind in Dungeons and Dragons. Along with beasts from known fantasy lore, like fairies and the manticore, were demons, horned clouds, and wisps riding bulls and warthogs. The images were illustrated beautifully in black ink, the vision of each monster realised with a shading style that made them bulge from the pages. One in particular caught my attention: a strikingly beautiful woman, dark tattoos covering her bare chest and donning a crown with horns. Her body invited lust. Her eyes dared me into a touch. I ran my fingers across the image and was taken away.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"separator separator--dots\" />\n\n  <p>\n    London was under siege. Its people were stooped, eyes firmly on the stone bricks, lifting their heads only to gauge the next ten steps. There was no danger of bumping into one another. They dared not touch. Most did not leave their homes.<br><br>The Black Death could not sympathise with the repercussions of its presence. It knew nothing of clemency. It thrived in the weakened human spirit, the pessimism working as fuel in the body for its abduction of it. The plague had killed many. Starvation and isolation, many more.<br><br>The wealthy steered clear of the accumulated filth in the neighbouring streets, relying on their stores and city gardens for sustenance. Many of them greeted one another as they always had, with warm smiles and open arms. The merchant Otto, a follower of Christ, offered daily prayers for the sick.<br><br>Oliver, a tanner’s assistant, was afflicted. With opaque, failing eyes, he forced himself up from his position under Otto’s kitchen window and staggered toward the market square, feeling along the familiar stone of houses and shops. There, representatives of the Brotherhood of the Holy Trinity tended to swaths of infected people under a silk tent. Writhing and groaning with delirium, the keening echoed through the narrow streets and the walkways of the canals, vocalising the eerie morning mist as if it were a disgruntled apparition.<br><br>As the tanner arrived at an oak desk at the tent entrance, he crumpled into his own footprint. The attendant shouted for his colleagues, muffled by two inches of knitted scarf wrapped around his mouth and nose. A beaked plague doctor parted the tent curtains with two fingers to observe, then blew on a short wooden flute.<br><br>Otto the merchant had planted a seed of hatred in the tanner. Lying on a narrow plinth, surrounded by beaked figures in black garments, he became vociferous in his contempt.<br><br>'He did not feed me. He did not quench my thirst. He did not offer me warmth. Is love not an action? Is an eternal inheritance not worthy of an intercession?'<br><br>The plague doctor Ruben had observed the tanner’s slumped body at the merchant's window on his way to the tent every morning, for a full month. He stayed by Oliver’s side until sunset and caught the tanner’s last gasp before reaching into his pocket for a stocky and tightly rolled scroll. He whispered a secret from its passages into the howling gale at the tent entrance, then returned to his duties.<br><br>Otto, complacent, had considered his soul secure with God, though an angel was perturbed by the merchant’s lack of action.<br><br>'I see his clean water, full store cupboards, and personal physician. Why does this man have compulsions to pray for assistance from God when he knows perfectly well the tools to restore the tanner are stocked in his pantry? He feeds and waters his goat, but has nothing spare for this man? The blessings bestowed upon him were for untested service. Now that he is in conflict with the Black Death, should those blessings be hoarded? To God, this is murder of the spirit. He will not help him. God will let the demon have its mischief.'<br><br>Otto could not hear the angel. His heart was firmly hardened, aligned with fleshy fear. He continued to pray for the sick, quietly and ineffectually. Full of misplaced confidence in his place with God, he returned from church with a skip in his step. As he entered his home, the merchant tilted his head to better hear the singing of local children—and was filled with terror.<br><br>‘London is in trouble with the Lord, its people wear his wounds,<br>the poor were first, their wounds did burst, now the merchant has it too.’<br><br>Otto rushed through his door; its slam coincided with sudden darkness. With arms outstretched, he staggered blindly through an atmosphere thick with unease. A stream of light appeared before him, revealing the deceased tanner on a bed of quivering moss. Feeling an itch on his hand, the merchant raised it to the light and saw a boil-like swell. He screamed for an explanation from God, then for His help.<br><br>Over the drone of flies, the merchant once again heard the singing of children:<br><br>‘For the merchant in his bubble, kept the lifeblood in his stores,<br>and as London cried for help, the merchant kept it all.<br>A wheel of cheese for the tanner. A wheel of cheese for the tanner.’\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"separator separator--dots\" />\n\n  <p>\n    I yanked my hand from the page as if from the jaws of a guillotine. I had seen something inexplicable—through the eyes and ears of people I could never meet, from a time I could never be truly present. It had all played out not as a dream or imagined scene, but as a vivid, living moment, observed from above. I had hovered over cobbled alleys and crooked rooftops, gliding on silent wings through a city ravaged by disease and dread. I had been a watcher—a bird, unseen, drifting above despair and judgement. It had been real. Too real. And now that I’d returned, something in me was different. As though a thin veil had lifted—one I hadn’t known was there.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"separator separator--long-line\" />\n\n  <p>\n    \n  </p>\n<div><style type=\"text/css\">\n.maxbutton {\n  position: relative;\n  text-decoration: none;\n  display: inline-block;\n  vertical-align: middle;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 40px;\n  border-width: 0px;\n  border-radius: 0px 0px 0px 0px;\n  background-color: #3A3A3A;\n  box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px 0px #333333;\n}\n.maxbutton:hover {\n  background-color: #3A3A3A;\n  box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px 0px #333333;\n  text-decoration: none;\n}\n.maxbutton .mb-text {\n  color: #F7D6FF;\n  font-size: 17px;\n  text-align: center;\n  font-style: normal;\n  font-weight: normal;\n  line-height: 1em;\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n  display: block;\n  background-color: unset;\n  position: relative;\n  padding: 12px 10px 10px 10px;\n  text-shadow: 0px 0px 0px #505ac7;\n}\n.maxbutton:hover .mb-text {\n  color: #7AA1FE;\n  text-shadow: 0px 0px 0px #333333;\n}\n</style>\n<a class=\"maxbutton\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/63EFNWXTQL8CL\" data-maxbuttoncounter=\"{&quot;button_id&quot;:570264,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/www.paypal.com\\/ncp\\/payment\\/63EFNWXTQL8CL&quot;,&quot;check&quot;:&quot;7eGPfQU_&quot;}\" data-maxbuttonpage=\"{&quot;id&quot;:false,&quot;type&quot;:false}\"><span class='mb-text' data-nofont>I Don&#039;t Paywall.
