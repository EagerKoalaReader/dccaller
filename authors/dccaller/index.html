However, neither explain why or how the rules behind those forms and functions exist in the first place. They merely express patterns and regularities in a system that is already rules-based.

This is “Routine: The Motion Picture.” Five tales. Zero coherence. One unforgettable, deeply unnecessary cinematic universe. Read aloud in your best 80s trailer voice — or don’t.

Strong and upright, the slight hunch she’d always carried was gone. Her carriage reminded me of an encyclopaedia illustration I once saw of Joan of Arc rallying troops — resolute, beckoning confrontation.

An old-fashioned lamp on the driveway had come on, likely on a timer to light the way on short winter days. Rain fell with impossible ferocity, though the windows remained free of droplets.

However, recent insights from neuroscience and cognitive psychology provide a compelling alternative reading that underscores the narrative’s anthropological and cognitive depth.

I watched Mrs. Tapscott stride across the room to the bottle green door. As she went through, I noticed Mrs. Rabasandratana had joined me. She glared at me for several minutes.

Neither his scraggly shoulder-length hair nor his coat were blowing with the wind. By this point, the rain was so heavy that large pools of water had formed in dips in the shingle where cars had driven through.

Each story, no longer than five sentences, is a miniature plunge into a world where logic unravels, meaning slips through your fingers, and the bizarre feels oddly familiar. Talking furniture, misplaced gravity, and existential fruit all coexist without explanation or apology. These tales don’t seek sense—they celebrate nonsense.

The paper, much like the village itself, offered nothing but petty crime, damp politics, and obituary columns. She’d once cared — once fought — but the creeping disillusionment that had infected Farneholme’s older folk had finally reached her too. Whatever fire she’d held for saving this place had gone out.

Its people were stooped — eyes firmly on the stone bricks, lifting their heads only to gauge the next ten steps. There was no danger of bumping into one another. They dared not touch. Most did not leave their homes. The Black Death could not sympathise with the repercussions of its presence — it knew nothing of clemency.

Mrs. Tapscott kept asking what was wrong, and each time, Rosie glanced at the bearded man, almost as if seeking permission to speak. She’d adjust her sitting position and temporarily stop scanning the room. This pattern repeated itself. I noticed Mrs. Tapscott shooting disapproving looks at the man, who remained absorbed in Rosie.
